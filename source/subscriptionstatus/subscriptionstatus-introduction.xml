    <h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
    <p>
      This document contains information about the <code>SubscriptionStatus</code> resource and details specific to options in it.  It is defined as part of the topic-based model of Subscriptions (Publish / Subscribe pattern).
    </p>
    <p>
      The <code>SubscriptionStatus</code> resource is used to convey information about the current state of a <a href="subscription.html">Subscription</a> and the contents of a notification.  Information contained within a <code>SubscriptionStatus</code> falls into three categories:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Information to identify the relevant <code>Subscription</code> (e.g., a reference to a <code>Subscription</code>, <code>SubscriptionTopic</code>)
        </li>
        <li>
          Information about the current state of the <code>Subscription</code> (e.g., Subscription status, number of events the Subscription has generated)
        </li>
        <li>
          Information about the current notification (e.g., notification type, the events in this notification)
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
  </div>

    <h2>Boundaries and Relationships</h2>

      The <code>SubscriptionStatus</code> resource is used in topic-based FHIR Subscriptions.
