<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>

<p>The ActorDefinition Resource represents an actor that can play the role of a participant
in some kind of described process.</p>

<p>
ActorDefinitions can be referenced in several places:
<li>[<a href="examplescenario.html">ExampleScenarios</a>] which show how data might flow in different situations.</li>
<li>[<a href="plandefinition.html">PlanDefinition</a>] which defines how a workflow should/is allowed to occur amongst a set of actors.</li>
<li>[<a href="requirements.html">Requirements</a>] which defines higher level expectations about system capabilities.</li>
<li>The [<a href="obligations.html">obligation</a>] extension, which allows system behaviors to be defined on a per-element basis.</li>
<li>[<a href="capabilitystatement.html">CapabilityStatement</a>] which allows pointing to ActorDefinitions to describe the specific sets of functionality supported by (or that should be supported by) systems (via obligations)</li>
</p>

<p>
Like all canonical resources, ActorDefinitions can be defined, published and managed in ImplementationGuides and used to describe
expected capabilities and roles within the IG, but can also be leveraged (via dependencies) by other implementation guides.

<h2>Boundaries and Relationships</h2>

<p>
Once defined, Actors may be asociated with <a href="obligations.html">obligations</a> defined in profiles to describe
expected application behavior.
</p>
<p>
Actors may also be referenced from <a href="examplescenario.html">ExampleScenario</a>.
