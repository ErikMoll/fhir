<h3>Rules Processing Logic</h3>
<!-- These rules are repeated on the comment element within the StructureDefinition -->
<p>
Each <code>.rule</code> is evaulated within the combining rule identified in the <code>.combining</code> element.
</p>
<p>
    Within a <code>.rule</code> any repititions of the <code>.data</code> element are in an OR relationship. That is to say that the data identified by the rule is all the data identified by all repititions of <code>.data</code>. Thus to identify one rule that applies to data tagged with <code>STD</code> and data that is tagged with <code>HIV</code>, one would repeat this at the <code>.data</code> level.
</p>
<p>
    Within a <code>.rule</code> any repititions of the <code>.activity</code> element are in an OR relationship. That is to say that the rule applies to all the repititions of <code>.activity</code>. Thus to identify one rule that applies to both <code>TREAT</code> and <code>HOPERAT</code>, one would have one rule with repititions at the .activity level.
</p>
<p>
    Within a <code>.rule</code> all repititions of the <code>.limit</code> all apply to the rule. That is to say if there are multiple limits, and the rule permits the activity, then all the identified limits are applied to that authorized activity. 
</p>
<p>
    Within the <code>.data</code> element, all elements and all repetitions of elements, are in an AND relationship. Thus to select data that has both <code>STD</code> and <code>HIV</code> one puts both into one <code>.rule</code>. To have different rules for <code>STD</code> from <code>HIV</code>, one would need to have two <code>.rule</code> elements. To have a rule that applies to both, those that have just <code>STD</code> and just <code>HIV</code>, this repitition may also be done at the data level as described above.
</p>
<p>
    Within the <code>.activity</code> element, all elements and all repetitions of elements, are in an AND relationship. Thus to control an actity that is covering purpose of both <code>TREAT</code> and <code>HOPERAT</code>, one rule with an <code>.activity</code> <code>.purpose</code> holding both <code>TREAT</code> and <code>HOPERAT</code> can define that rule. However this will not cover activities covering only <code>TREAT</code>, for that repeat at the <code>.activity</code> with just a <code>.purpose</code> of <code>TREAT</code>.
